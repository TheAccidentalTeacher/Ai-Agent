This is a test document for the Monica-style chat attachment system.

It contains multiple paragraphs to test document processing.

The system should:
1. Upload this file to Supabase Storage
2. Download it for processing
3. Extract the text content
4. Store it in the database with word count and metadata

If you can read this in the chat, the document attachment system is working correctly!
