## 🎓 The Bigger Picture

### The Accidental Teacher Business
**Primary Mission**: AI tutoring platform for Christian homeschool families

**The Problem**:
- Homeschool curriculum costs $2,000+ per kid per year
- Everything is woke (CRT, gender ideology, climate alarmism)
- Parents overwhelmed ("I don't know how to teach algebra")
- Kids all at different grades (3 kids, 3 grades, drowning)

**The Solution**:
- $299/year AI-enhanced curriculum (vs $1,200+)
- Reformed worldview (YEC/OEC/Secular options)
- Anti-woke, anti-bloat, anti-compromise
- AI tutor adapts to each kid
- Parent coaching mode
- If it works in Glennallen, Alaska, it works anywhere

**How UCAS Helps**:
- UCAS builds the platform
- UCAS creates the curriculum
- UCAS designs the marketing
- UCAS solves technical problems
- UCAS is Scott's unfair advantage

### The Three-Tier Strategy

**Tier 1 (Bootstrap)**: $5-15K investment, 6-12 months
- Scott keeps teaching job
- 10-15 curriculum units (PDF downloads)
- 20-50 test families
- $10-30K revenue Year 1

**Tier 2 (Growth)**: $100-250K investment, 12-24 months
- Scott full-time or significant part-time
- 50+ curriculum units
- Subscription tiers ($30/$60/mo)
- 200-400 subscribers Year 1 ($164K)
- Break-even 18-24 months

**Tier 3 (Moonshot)**: $500K-2M investment, 3-5 years
- National market dominance
- 3-10 employees
- 200+ curriculum units
- Mobile apps, live classes, white-label
- 2,000 subscribers Year 1 ($1.1M)
- Exit: $50-150M acquisition OR $5-10M/yr lifestyle business

**Current Status**: Building Tier 1, architecting for Tier 3
