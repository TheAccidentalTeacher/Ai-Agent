## 🧠 Memory & Knowledge Management

This is the **secret weapon** of the application. It automatically remembers everything you do and makes it searchable.

### What Is the Memory System?

Think of it like having a **perfect photographic memory** that:
- Automatically saves everything you do
- Organizes it intelligently
- Lets you search by meaning (not just keywords)
- Shows connections between different sessions

### How Auto-Memory Works

**You don't do anything!** The system automatically tracks:
- Video analysis sessions
- Creative Studio generations
- AI chat conversations
- Research activities
- Project work

**Auto-Save Triggers:**
The system saves your session when:
1. You've done **10 activities** (clicks, generates, etc.)
2. **5 minutes** of active work have passed
3. You **close or refresh** the page

**What Happens:**
1. System collects all your activities
2. AI generates a human-readable summary
3. AI creates tags (e.g., "video", "education", "biology")
4. Everything is saved to the cloud
5. You see a subtle notification: **"💾 Auto-saved to Memory"**

### Using the Memory Tab

#### Step 1: Open Memory Tab
1. Click the **🧠 Memory** tab in the AI Panel
2. You'll see two sub-tabs: **Search** and **Graph**

### Search Sub-Tab

#### Semantic Search
This is **not regular keyword search**. It understands **meaning**.

**Example:**
- Search: `"learning about cells"`
- Will find memories about:
  - "biology video on cellular structure"
  - "generated quiz about mitochondria"
  - "research on plant vs animal cells"
- Even if the word "learning" isn't in them!

**How to Search:**
1. Type your query in the search box
2. Press Enter or click 🔍
3. Results appear instantly

**Search Tips:**
```
"videos about history"          ← Find all history videos
"images I generated yesterday"  ← Find recent images
"research on theology"          ← Find research sessions
"conversations about coding"    ← Find chat sessions
```

#### Filter Results

**By Content Type:**
- 📚 Research
- 📝 Manual note
- 🎥 Video analysis
- 🎨 Creative generation
- 💬 Conversation

**By Date Range:**
- From: [Select start date]
- To: [Select end date]
- Find memories from specific time periods

#### Understanding Results

Each memory card shows:
- **Type icon** (📚🎥🎨💬📝)
- **Similarity score** (0.95 = perfect match, 0.70 = related)
- **Title** (AI-generated summary)
- **Date** (when it was saved)
- **Preview** (first 200 characters)
- **Tags** (#education #video #biology)

**Similarity Scores:**
- **0.90+** - Exactly what you're looking for
- **0.80-0.89** - Very relevant
- **0.70-0.79** - Related/useful
- **Below 0.70** - Tangentially related

### Graph Sub-Tab

**What Is This?**
A visual **knowledge graph** showing connections between your memories. Think of it like a mind map of everything you've done.

**Why Use It?**
- See connections between different topics
- Discover patterns in your work
- Understand your learning journey
- Find related memories visually

#### How the Graph Works

**Nodes (Circles):**
- Each circle = one saved memory
- **Color** = content type
  - 🔵 Blue = Research
  - 🔴 Red = Video
  - 🟢 Green = Creative
  - 🟡 Yellow = Conversation
  - ⚪ White = Manual note

**Links (Lines):**
- Lines connect related memories
- **Thickness** = strength of connection
- Thick line = very related
- Thin line = somewhat related

**Size:**
- Bigger circle = more connections
- Smaller circle = fewer connections

#### Interacting with the Graph

**Navigation:**
- **Scroll** to zoom in/out
- **Click and drag** background to pan
- **Drag a node** to move it (it stays pinned)
- **Double-click a node** to unpin (lets physics move it)

**Hover Effects:**
- **Hover over a node**: Connected nodes and links highlight in gold
- Other nodes fade to 20% opacity
- Easy to see relationships

**Click for Details:**
- **Click any node**: Opens a detailed modal with:
  - Full title and content
  - All tags
  - Creation date
  - Connection count (how many links)
  - Full metadata
  - **Copy button** to copy the content

**Filters:**
- **Content Type**: Show only research, videos, creative, etc.
- **Date Range**: Filter by when memories were created
- Updates graph in real-time

**Export:**
- **PNG**: Save graph as image
- **SVG**: Save as scalable vector (for editing)
- **JSON**: Export data for programming

#### Understanding Connections

**How are memories connected?**
Currently connections are based on **shared tags**. In the future (Days 11-12), connections will also use:
- **Semantic similarity** (similar meaning/topics)
- **Temporal proximity** (created around same time)
- **Combined strength** (weighted algorithm)

**Example:**
If you:
1. Researched "photosynthesis"
2. Watched a video on "plant biology"
3. Generated a quiz about "cells"

The graph will show these three nodes connected because they share tags like #biology, #education, #plants.

### Memory Best Practices

**Trust the Auto-Save:**
- Don't worry about manually saving
- System captures everything automatically
- Just focus on your work!

**Use Good Search Terms:**
- Think about the **meaning** of what you want
- Don't overthink exact keywords
- The AI understands context

**Explore the Graph:**
- Spend time clicking around
- Discover unexpected connections
- See your knowledge grow over time

**Clean Up Periodically:**
- The system stores unlimited memories
- But you might want to delete old/irrelevant ones
- (Delete feature coming in Days 15-17)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "I can't see the AI Panel"
**Solution:**
1. Look for the **🤖** button (usually on the right side)
2. Try refreshing the page (F5)
3. Check if your browser window is wide enough (needs 1200px+)

#### "Video transcript won't load"
**Reasons:**
- Video doesn't have captions/subtitles
- Video is private or age-restricted
- Video is too new (transcripts take time)

**Solution:**
1. Look for videos with the [CC] icon on YouTube
2. Try a different video
3. Use "Auto-generated" captions if available

#### "Image generation is taking forever"
**Normal times:**
- DALL-E 3: 15-30 seconds
- Flux 2 Pro: 20-40 seconds
- Stable Diffusion: 10-20 seconds

**If it's stuck (2+ minutes):**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Refresh the page
3. Try a different model

#### "My memories aren't showing up"
**Checklist:**
1. Are you signed in? (Check top-right corner)
2. Have you done at least 10 activities?
3. Try searching for broader terms
4. Check if you have filters applied (remove them)

#### "The graph isn't displaying"
**Solutions:**
1. Make sure you're in the **Graph** sub-tab (not Search)
2. You need at least 2 memories for connections
3. Try clicking "Type Filter" and selecting "All"
4. Refresh the page

#### "Authentication failed"
**Solution:**
1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
